# Edunnovate Technologies- Data Science
At Edunnovate Technologies, our mission is to equip young people with real world skills that would transform them into innovators and problem solvers. In this course, we cover the essentials of Classical Machine Learning or the Pre-Deep Learning era. The readers are then introduced to Deep Learning - the backbone of Artificial Intelligence today.

Following is the course structure that we are going to follow throughout the course:



“Machine intelligence is the last invention that humanity will ever need to make.”    -Nick Bostrom

# Structure of the Course

## Week 1
***
We begin our journey in the world of Machine Learning by laying down the foundation stone of various associated domains of Mathematics and Coding skills. 

* We head on to one of the most important skills of Machine Learning namely **Data Plotting and Visualisation**. It is one of the first steps to solve a machine learning challenge. Unless one is familiar with the data he/she will deal with is essential to developing a good Machine Learning model for the task. 
* We talk about **Data Distribution** which is central to understanding the kind of model that can be used to solve the problem at hand.
* Let us say, we know what data we want to deal with and know about it's distribution but we generally can't feed the data directly to our model and hence it is essential to **prepare** the data and **pre-process** it as per need of our model. So, we look at a really useful library called Pandas.
* Having prepared the data, now the question is, how to process it efficiently. Here creeps in **Numpy - Numerical Python**. One of the most extensively used libaries for computing and widely used to speed up the task at hand.
* We now try to acclimatise readers with Machine Learning foundations namely, **Calculus and Linear Algebra**.
