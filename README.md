# Edunnovate Technologies- Data Science
At Edunnovate Technologies, our mission is to equip young people with real world skills that would transform them into innovators and problem solvers. In this course, we cover the essentials of Classical Machine Learning or the Pre-Deep Learning era. The readers are then introduced to Deep Learning - the backbone of Artificial Intelligence today.

Following is the course structure that we are going to follow throughout the course:

# Structure of the Course

## Week 1
***
We begin our journey in the world of Machine Learning by laying down the foundation stone of various associated domains of Mathematics and Coding skills. 

* We head on to one of the most important skills of Machine Learning namely **Data Plotting and Visualisation**. It is one of the first steps to solve a machine learning challenge. Unless one is familiar with the data he/she will deal with is essential to developing a good Machine Learning model for the task. 
* We talk about **Data Distribution** which is central to understanding the kind of model that can be used to solve the problem at hand.
* Let us say, we know what data we want to deal with and know about it's distribution but we generally can't feed the data directly to our model and hence it is essential to **prepare** the data and **pre-process** it as per need of our model. So, we look at a really useful library called Pandas.
* Having prepared the data, now the question is, how to process it efficiently. Here creeps in **Numpy - Numerical Python**. One of the most extensively used libaries for computing and widely used to speed up the task at hand.
* We now try to acclimatise readers with Machine Learning foundations namely, **Calculus and Linear Algebra**.

## Week 2
***
After brushing up the Basics, in the second week of course, we step into 2 important terms:- Data Analytics and Machine Learning. We begin our walk with basics of Machine Learning i.e. Regression and Classification. 

* We first introduce to the essential Python packages for data science and understand the definition of Machine Learning and types of machine learning algorithms. 
* **Linear Regression** is probably one of the most fundamental ideas in Machine Learning and in fact, Machine Learning build around Linear Regression.
* A more efficient model than simple Linear Regression finds it's way onto the middle often referred to as **Segmented Regression**. We talk about the relative performance of this model wrt Simple Linear Regression. 
* A really good Linear Regression model based on really good observations is **Locally Weighted Regression**, which we talk in detail about.
* We practice **Exploratory Data Analysis** techniques with our very first real coding experience which lays a great foundation for Data analysis on Classification and Regression problems under Supervised machine learning.
