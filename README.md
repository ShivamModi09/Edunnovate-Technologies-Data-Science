# Edunnovate Technologies- Data Science
At Edunnovate Technologies, our mission is to equip young people with real world skills that would transform them into innovators and problem solvers. In this course, we cover the essentials of Classical Machine Learning or the Pre-Deep Learning era. The readers are then introduced to Deep Learning - the backbone of Artificial Intelligence today.

Following is the course structure that we are going to follow throughout the course:

# Structure of the Course

## Week 1
***
We begin our journey in the world of Machine Learning by laying down the foundation stone of various associated domains of Mathematics and Coding skills. 

* We head on to one of the most important skills of Machine Learning namely **Data Plotting and Visualisation**. It is one of the first steps to solve a machine learning challenge. Unless one is familiar with the data he/she will deal with is essential to developing a good Machine Learning model for the task. 
* We talk about **Data Distribution** which is central to understanding the kind of model that can be used to solve the problem at hand.
* Let us say, we know what data we want to deal with and know about it's distribution but we generally can't feed the data directly to our model and hence it is essential to **prepare** the data and **pre-process** it as per need of our model. So, we look at a really useful library called Pandas.
* Having prepared the data, now the question is, how to process it efficiently. Here creeps in **Numpy - Numerical Python**. One of the most extensively used libaries for computing and widely used to speed up the task at hand.
* We now try to acclimatise readers with Machine Learning foundations namely, **Calculus and Linear Algebra**.

## Week 2
***
After brushing up the Basics, in the second week of course, we step into 2 important terms:- Data Analytics and Machine Learning. We begin our walk with basics of Machine Learning i.e. Regression and Classification. 

* We first introduce to the essential Python packages for data science and understand the definition of Machine Learning and types of machine learning algorithms. 
* **Linear Regression** is probably one of the most fundamental ideas in Machine Learning and in fact, Machine Learning build around Linear Regression.
* A more efficient model than simple Linear Regression finds it's way onto the middle often referred to as **Segmented Regression**. We talk about the relative performance of this model wrt Simple Linear Regression. 
* A really good Linear Regression model based on really good observations is **Locally Weighted Regression**, which we talk in detail about.
* We practice **Exploratory Data Analysis** techniques with our very first real coding experience which lays a great foundation for Data analysis on Classification and Regression problems under Supervised machine learning.

## Week 3
***
This week, we are ready with diving deep into concepts & techniques of Data Analysis. Then, we initiate towards understanding theory and coding aspects of machine learning algorithms.

* We try to build upon the Data Analysis we learned in Week 1 & 2 by understanding **Exploratory Data Analysis** and **Data Pre-Processing**.
* We learn about **Visualization for analyzing individual feature patterns**, **Descriptive Statistical Analysis**, **Basics of Grouping**, **ANOVA** and **Correlation & Causation**.
* We begin studying algorithms starting with **Logistic Regression** which is conceptually based on linear regression but predicts the probability of a class, its output values lies between 0 and 1. Thus, it's used for classification purpose.
* We then talk about a non-parametric learning model called the **Decision Tree**. This is a really simple idea and the first glance may seem to be trivial but is a really powerful model for both **Regression** and **Classification**. It is really important to understand this well as this was used and is still in use extensively.

## Week 4
---
These week, the focus is more on studying various Supervised Machine learning algorithms used for purposes of classification mainly. It helps a lot in competing in various communities. One of the most such famous community is **Kaggle**. It has a very famous competition known as **Titanic-Machine Learning from Disaster** which is assignment itself for this week and requires Data Analysis techniques to solve. 

* We start with talking about **Support Vector Machine**. Then, we look at Python code which uses scikit library to implement this algorithm.
* We then look at an algorithm which has outperform even highly sophisticated classification algorithms known as **Naive Bayes**. This algorithm is based on **Bayes Theorem** and Python's scikit library can be used for its implementation.
* **K Nearest Neighbor** is a very simple, supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression problems. We see how we can make use of scikit library's knn method for both regression as well as classification purpose.
* We then talk about **Ensemble**. We talk about an ensemble of **Decision Trees** known as **Random Forest** and see the use scikit library for this task using Python code.
 
## Week 5
---
This week we take a flavour of **Neural Networks** that have revolutionised the field of Artifical Intelligence. It is used extensively in almost every domain of Artifical Learning. With it's advent, the conventional learning models lost their importance because in some sense this unifies everything into one and only one model that can do almost everything that the machine learning models do.

* We talk about the fundamentals of Neural Nets and the associated mathematics for a better understanding of it's working.
* We also talk about few general concepts like **Loss Function** and **Optimisation techniques**.
* From this week onwards, we also start to look at practical aspects of Machine Learning models which are undoubtedly the determiners of efficiency of a model. They are crucial things to which one must arrive at before diving into to solving the task at hand.
* We also introduce some statistical concepts that are closely related to Machine Learning and are fundamental to the understanding of Machine learning models.
* We also give a few practice exercises to get your understanding clear on this really important model.
## Week 6
---
This week, we start with implementation details of Neural Networks in Standard Libraries like Tensorflow and Keras. We also try to further our knowledge of Neural Nets with more advanced concepts.

* We start with tutorials on **tensorflow** and **Keras** where we learn about the implementation of Neural Nets and applying them to tasks.
* We then head on to Convolutional Neural Nets. Probaby one of the greatest developments in the field of Deep Learning that has indeed changed the field of Computer Vision completely. 
* We talk a lot of detail about CNN's and introduce you to **Conv Layers** and **Pooling Layers**.
* A short exercise has been given to acquaint readers with Neural Nets and Convolutional Neural Nets.
## Week 7
---
This week we jump into a subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence called **Natural Language Processing** (NLP). We further enquire about another hot topic of AI era: **Reinforcement Learning**.

* We see the use of a popular open-source package in Python called **NLTK**(Natural Language Toolkit) which provides all common NLP Tasks. 
* Then we learn about the essential preprocessing techniques involved for NLP text type datasets which includes **Vectorization** and **Feature Engineering**.
* We finally conclude with understanding autonomous applications of Deep Reinforcement Learning and how it can be used in large environments conceptually.
 
## Week 8
---
This week we first encounter with a widely used unsupervised learning alogrithm called **K-Means Clustering**. We learn about some other important Data Science terms along this week. Still the main focus of this week is on a famous Deep Learning library called **PyTorch** which is more of a pythonic framework and feels like a new language compared to tensorflow.

* We see an unsupervised learning algorithm which solves the clustering problems and take help of scikit's python code to implement a k-means model for any training dataset.
* Then we learn about a language called **SQL (Structured Query Language)** which allows you to talk to databases.
* To gain better understandings of this library, we finally discuss the **Image Classification example with PyTorch**.

With this we come to the end of our course that was developed completely by the **Edunnovate Technologies** with great efforts and an ambition to give the reader a tour of the really amazing Data Science field and acquaint you with the potential of Artificial Intelligence to revolutionise the era of technology and make this world even more exciting.
