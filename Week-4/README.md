# Week 4

Welcome to Week 3! This week we will be covering many more powerful classical machine learning algorithms before moving onto modern (aka deep learning) algorithms next week.
So let's get started we have a busy week ahead of us!

## Support Vector Machines
A Support Vector Machine(SVM) is a discriminative classifier formally defined by a separating hyperplane.<br/> 
In other words, given labeled training data(supervised learning), the algorithm outputs an optimal hyperplane which categorizes new examples. In two dimensional space this hyperplane is a line dividing a plane in two parts where in each class lay in either side.
### Kaggle
Kaggle is an online community of data scientists and machine learning practitioners. Kaggle allows users to find and publish data sets, explore and build models in a web-based data-science environment, work with other data scientists and machine learning engineers, and enter competitions to solve data science challenges.

You can download the data from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) and participate in the competition.

It's advised to do this by your own but still if you want, you can refer the above file or [this](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1U57lxLQ2sMIv4j_YPRoCIVw78186iWn6?usp=sharing) link for your pursual. 

The course upto now was devoted to Data Analytics and Machine Learning techniques. So, here we conclude this week and from next week, we'll learn about important Deep Learning techniques where most of research happens presently.
