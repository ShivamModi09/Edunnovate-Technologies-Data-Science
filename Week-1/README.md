## Introduction

Even though Artificial Intelligence doesn't actually need an introduction in today's world, where millions of people research in this field, and where every other day there's a new state of the art techinique. Data Science is basically automating and improving the learning process of computers based on their experiences without being actually programmed i.e. without any human assistance. At its core, data science is a field of study that aims to use a scientific approach to extract meaning and insights from data. Machine learning, on the other hand, refers to a group of techniques used by data scientists that allow computers to learn from data. These techniques produce results that perform well without programming explicit rules.

In Traditional Programming, We feed in Data (Input) + Program (Logic), run it on machine and get output.

While in Machine Learning, We feed in Data (Input) + Output, run it on machine during training and the machine creates its own program(Logic), which can be evaluated while testing.

Excited? Now go on, begin your journey into this vast and the most buzzing field in Computer Science here.

## Data Visualization using Matplotlib

Before creating analytical models, a data scientist must develop an understanding of the properties and relationships in a dataset. There are two goals for data exploration and visualization -
- To understand the relationships between the data columns.
- To identify features that may be useful for predicting labels in machine learning projects. Additionally, redundant, collinear features can be identified.

Thus, visualization for data exploration is an essential data science skill. Here, we’ll learn to analyze data via various types of plots offered by matplotlib and seaborn library.

### Useful Resources

## Data Distribution

The data that we have for our model can come from a variety of distributions. Having an understanding of the data distribution helps in making an informed decision about the model that we can use. Let us briefly talk about some data distributions -

## Data Preparations using Pandas

### Introduction to Pandas
It's an open source data analysis library for providing easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools. It comes handy for data manipulation and analysis.

### Benifits
- A lot of functionality
- Active community
- Extensive documentation
- Plays well with other packages
- Built on top of NumPy
- Works well with scikit-learn

## Numpy 
### Introduction

NumPy (Numerical Python) is a linear algebra library in Python. It is a very important library on which almost every data science or machine learning Python package such as SciPy (Scientific Python), Mat−plotlib (plotting library), Scikit-learn, etc depends on to a great extent. 
NumPy is very useful for performing mathematical and logical operations on Arrays. It provides an abundance of useful features for operations on n-arrays and matrices in Python. 
One of the main advantages of Numpy is that vectorisation using numpy arrays makes it super time efiicient. It enables parallel computation that makes it so fast and hence extremely useful.

## Mathematics for Data Science

Calculus and Linear Algebra are an integral part of Machine Learning. Let us brush up the basics so that our study of Machine Learning can be smooth and rigorous.
