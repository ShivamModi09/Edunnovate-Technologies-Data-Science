# Week-2 Data Analytics
***
Welcome to the Week 2! Having laid the foundations of Machine Learning, this week we start exercising Data Analysis. Data Analysis plays an essential role in:
- Discovering Useful Information
- Answering Questions 
- Predicting Future or the unknown

## Pyhton Packages for Data Science
As, Python is used in this course, here are the important Python packages for a data scientist that will be needed for our projects. 

### 1) Scientific Computing Libraries
- Pandas (Data Structures and tools)
- NumPy (Arrays & Matrices)
- SciPy (Integrals, solving Differential Equations, Optimization)

### 2) Visualization Libraries
- Matplotlib (plots & graphs, most popular)
- Seaborn (plots: heat maps, time series, violin plots)

### 3) Algorithmic Libraries
- Scikit-learn (ML: Rergession, Classification)
