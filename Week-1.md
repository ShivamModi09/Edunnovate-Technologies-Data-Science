## Introduction 

Even though ML doesn't actually need an introduction in today's world, where millions of people research in this field, and where every other day there's a new state of the art techinique. Machine Learning is basically automating and improving the learning process of computers based on their experiences without being actually programmed i.e. without any human assistance.

In Traditional Programming, We feed in Data (Input) + Program (Logic), run it on machine and get output.

While in Machine Learning, We feed in Data (Input) + Output, run it on machine during training and the machine creates its own program(Logic), which can be evaluated while testing.

Excited? Now go on, begin your journey into this vast and the most buzzing field in Computer Science here.
