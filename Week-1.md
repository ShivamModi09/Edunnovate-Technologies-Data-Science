## Introduction to Machine Learning

Even though ML doesn't actually need an introduction in today's world, where millions of people research in this field, and where every other day there's a new state of the art techinique. Machine Learning is basically automating and improving the learning process of computers based on their experiences without being actually programmed i.e. without any human assistance.

In Traditional Programming, We feed in Data (Input) + Program (Logic), run it on machine and get output.

While in Machine Learning, We feed in Data (Input) + Output, run it on machine during training and the machine creates its own program(Logic), which can be evaluated while testing.

Excited? Now go on, begin your journey into this vast and the most buzzing field in Computer Science here.

## Data Visualization using Matplotlib

Before creating analytical models, a data scientist must develop an understanding of the properties and relationships in a dataset. There are two goals for data exploration and visualization -
- To understand the relationships between the data columns.
- To identify features that may be useful for predicting labels in machine learning projects. Additionally, redundant, collinear features can be identified.

Thus, visualization for data exploration is an essential data science skill. Here, weâ€™ll learn to analyze data via various types of plots offered by matplotlib and seaborn library.
