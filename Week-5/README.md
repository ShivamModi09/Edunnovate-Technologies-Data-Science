# Week 5
***
Welcome to Week 5! This week you are going to develop your understanding about neural networks and deep learning. From here we'll start learning about one of the basic and crucial part of Data Scientist job.

Last week you studied about various machine learning algorithms.It’s a pertinent question. There is no shortage of machine learning algorithms so why should we gravitate towards deep learning algorithms? What do neural networks offer that traditional machine learning algorithms don’t?

## Why are neural nets preferred over traditional machine learning algorithms ?
- Decision Boundary: In the case of classification problems, the algorithm learns the function that separates 2 classes, this is known as a Decision boundary.
**_Every Machine Learning algorithm is not capable of learning all the functions. This limits the problems these algorithms can solve that involve a complex relationship whereas Neural Nets can compute any function._**
- Feature Engineering: Feature engineering is a key step in the model building process. It is a two-step process:
* ** Feature extraction: In feature extraction, we extract all the required features for our problem statement
* ** Feature selection: In feature selection, we select the important features that improve the performance of our machine learning or deep learning model.
Consider an image classification problem. Extracting features manually from an image needs strong knowledge of the subject as well as the domain. It is an extremely time-consuming process. Thanks to Deep Learning, we can automate the process of Feature Engineering! All you need to do is just enter raw data, and the neural nets will classify it into features with appropiate weights on it's own.

This week, we'll study about feedforward neural networks.
